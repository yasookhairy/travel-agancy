    ## How to Use
    
     1. **Customizing Content:**
     
      - Edit the content in each HTML file (`index.html`, `about.html`, `destinations.html`, `services.html`, `offers.html`) according to your needs. - Modify the images in the `assets/images/` directory to match your content.
      
     2. **Styling:** 
     
     - Custom CSS is located in `assets/css/style.css`. Classes are prefixed with page-specific identifiers like `home-`, `ab-`, `des-`, `ser-`, and `off-` to avoid conflicts. 
     
     3. **JavaScript:**
     
      - Custom JavaScript functionality is located in `assets/js/script.js`. The file includes initialization for AOS and Slick Carousel, as well as other interactive elements. 
      
      4. **Fonts and Icons:** - Google Fonts and Font Awesome are used for typography and icons.
